<h3 style="color:darkgreen;font-size:25px"> History </h3>
<div style="font-size:20px;background-color:black;color:BlueViolet">
<p> Despite significant European success in the <strong>1970s </strong>  and early <b>1980s</b>, the late <b>1980s</b> marked a low point for <b>English football</b>. Stadiums were crumbling, supporters endured poor facilities, hooliganism was rife, and English clubs had been banned from European competition for five years following the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985.[15] The Football League First Division, the top level of English football since 1888, was behind <b>leagues such as Italy's Serie A and Spain's La Liga</b> in attendances and revenues, and several top English players had moved abroad.
    

By the turn of the <b>1990s</B>, the downward trend was starting to reverse. At the <b>1990 FIFA World Cup</b>, England reached the semi-finals;<b> UEFA</b>, European football's governing body, lifted the <b>five-year ban on English clubs playing in European competitions in 1990</b>, resulting in <b>Manchester United lifting the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1991</b>. The Taylor Report on stadium safety standards, which proposed expensive upgrades to create all-seater stadiums in the aftermath of the <b>Hillsborough disaster</b>, was published in <b>January 1990</b>. </p> </div>
